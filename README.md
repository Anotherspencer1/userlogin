# Overview

This project was meant to get me started with web apps in Django.

I am attempting to create a basic user authentication app. I want a login page, and a registration page, where the user input crednetials are verified.

I decided to write this software to get me started with Django to hopefully eventually make a highly interactable shop website.

# Web Pages

So far I have two pages, a login page and a registration page. I have yet to implement functionality in these 
pages, but one can navigate between the two of them with different URL endings

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this software

This software was written in Python using the Django library.

# Useful Websites

Useful websites used:
* [Official Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)

# Future Work

* Add interface to login and registration pages
* Add database to store user credentials
* Integrate pages together to allow seamless transition between them.
