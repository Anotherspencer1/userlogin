# Overview

This project was meant to get me started with web apps in Django.

I have created the foundations of a larger web app by implementing user authentication.

I decided to write this software to get me started with Django to hopefully eventually make a web based notes app.

# Web Pages

I have created a hom page, login page, and registration page. These all seamlessly hand off to each other to create a smooth
user authentication experience.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this software

This software was written in Python using the Django library.

# Useful Websites

Useful websites used:
* [Official Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)

# Future Work

* Add some CSS to style the web pages I've added so far.
* Add functionality to the home page to allow the user to create notes.
